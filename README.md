# Interview Task

## Objective
Your task is to read in a data file and create logic to detect hunting activities with a CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) unit. If hunting occurs more than 5 times in a hour, it should be considered an alert.

## Data File
The data file contains timestamped entries of the CRAC unit's activities. Each entry includes a timestamp, Return Air Tempurature, Supply Air Temperature.

## Requirements
1. **Read the Data File**: Write a function to read the data file and parse the entries.
2. **Detect Hunting Activities**: Implement logic to detect hunting activities. Hunting is defined as rapid changes in the CRAC unit's supply temperature.
3. **Generate Alerts**: If hunting occurs more than 5 times within a hour, generate an alert.


## Deliverables
1. The code to read and parse the data file.
2. The logic to detect hunting activities.
3. The code to generate alerts when hunting occurs more than 5 times in a hour.
4. A brief explanation of your approach and any assumptions made.

## Submission
Please submit your solution as a GitHub repository link or a zip file containing your code and explanation.

Good luck!
